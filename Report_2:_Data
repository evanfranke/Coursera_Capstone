The data used for this effort will be the collision data published by SDOT, the Seattle Department of Transportation, which includes all collisions recorded from 2004 to 
May 2020. The data include 37 attributes for each collision, as well as the "severity level" of the collision itself - either an "injury collision" or a "property damage 
only collision." Attributes include location, intersection type, vehicle and occupant counts, date and time, and environmental conditions.

We will look for the subset of attributes that are reliable predictors of collisions by examining the relationship of each variable to collision severity. Any relationships
that appear non-random will be used to create a predictive model via machine learning algorithms. From an early review of the available attributes, we expect fields such as
"ADDRTYPE" (block / intersection / alley), "INCDTTM" (weekdays versus weekends, and commuting times), "ROADCOND" (wet / dry / ice and others), and "LIGHTCOND" (degrees of 
visibility) will likely be included in the model. There are many other descriptive fields available, but many of these would be difficult to translate into mathematical or 
categorical variables. The bulk of this effort is expected to be the discovery of which of the available attributes will ultimately be useful for our modeling.
