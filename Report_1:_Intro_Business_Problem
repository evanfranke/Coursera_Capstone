Report Section 1: Introduction/Business Problem

Knowledge and information, while omnipresent in today's society, are only beneficial if they can be communicated to others and converted to action. One promising area
is in data associated with traffic accidents. While we are likely decades away from autonomous vehicles dominating our roads, drivers do have more and more information
resources available to them while operating a vehicle that can enable them to make better informed decisions - decisions that can directly lead to increased safety.

The issue that will be addressed by this project is whether data collected on traffic incidents, when combined with meaningful attributes and characteristics, can be
translated into predictive models that can be utilized in real time to warn drivers of likely dangerous situations in time to mitigate, or completely avoid, potentially
dangerous traffic scenarios. These models, if proven even moderately accurate, could readily be integrated into existing end-user mobile device apps, as well as future
integrated software in vehicle software operating systems.
